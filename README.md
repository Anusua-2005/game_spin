# 🎰 On-Chain Spin Game (Solidity)

Welcome to the **On-Chain Spin Game** — a simple and fun blockchain-based game built using **Solidity**!  
Players can spin the on-chain wheel to win random rewards in Ether (ETH).  
All logic is transparent, fair, and verifiable directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## 🧩 Project Description

The **SpinGame** smart contract is a beginner-friendly decentralized game that demonstrates how to use Solidity to create a luck-based game with pseudo-random outcomes.  

It allows users to:
- Spin for rewards.
- Claim their winnings.
- Watch transactions and rewards on-chain for full transparency.

This project is perfect for developers who are learning Solidity, randomness handling, and basic smart contract design patterns.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Accepts a small **spin fee** (0.01 ETH by default).
- Generates a **pseudo-random number** using blockchain variables.
- Calculates the player’s reward based on probability tiers.
- Stores and allows users to **claim their earned Ether**.
- Lets the **contract owner withdraw** any remaining balance.
